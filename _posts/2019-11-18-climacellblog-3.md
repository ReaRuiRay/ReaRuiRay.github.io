*I wrote this blog for ClimaCell on how ozone and NO<sub>2</sub> change within a day. Reposted from ['ClimaCell Blog'](https://www.climacell.co/blog/dance-of-the-air-pollutants/)*

The most romantic part of the air pollution mechanism (i.e., atmospheric chemistry) is the dance between ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) on the surface of Earth. During this late night air molecule tango one pollutant takes a step forward, the other takes a step back. Following the rhythm set by the sun, they take turns leading the dance. As the sun rises, ozone plays the leading role. When dusk falls, O<sub>3</sub> yields to NO<sub>2</sub>.

We video-captured this dance in Los Angeles on October 29 2019, between midnight and 11:00 pm. The top two panels depict the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> in parts per billion (ppb). Background colors are archives of real-time pollutant concentrations from ClimaCell, and the colored circles are the data from ['AirNow'](https://airnow.gov/) (a governmental air pollution data platform). 

Roughly, when O<sub>3</sub> exceeds 70 ppb or NO<sub>2</sub> exceeds 100 ppb, it means bad air quality – based on ['National Ambient Air Quality Standards'](https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table). The lower panel is the diurnal cycle of the two pollutants. The x-axis ranges from 00:00 to 23:00 local time, and y-axis represents the pollutant concentrations in parts per billion.

During the wee small hours, O<sub>3</sub> gracefully drops to below 5 ppb and regains its spirit at around 9:00 am, peaking at over 40 ppb around 14:00. Meanwhile, NO<sub>2</sub> drops after 9:00 am and reaches its nadir around 14:00. 

**Reads like a great partnership, doesn’t it?**

So what’s the trick? Stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> (good ozone protecting us from UV) high above us is produced from oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) directly. But in the lower troposphere where we live, ozone is bad and can be produced by robbing one oxygen atom from NO<sub>2</sub>. 

That’s why NO<sub>2</sub> stays low during the daytime. The chemical reaction is:

*O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) + NO<sub>2</sub> + hv (sun light) → O<sub>3</sub>+ NO (nitrogen monoxide)*

When the sunlight’s gone and night comes, O<sub>3</sub> proves to be most generous and gives the oxygen atom back to NO<sub>2</sub>. Fresh NO is still produced during the nighttime, via fossil fuel combustion. NO grasps the oxygen, and sometimes leaves a little O<sub>3</sub> behind. Hereby, we see very low levels of O<sub>3</sub> during the nighttime. 

**The take-away formula is:**

*O<sub>3</sub> + NO → O<sub>2</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub>*


**One good turn deserves another…**
