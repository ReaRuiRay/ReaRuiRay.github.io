It is very common to think that the great barrier of the Himalayas protect the Tibetan Plateau from air pollution in the south. However, this is not true. When the transport pattern at higher levels is favorable, the transport of pollution from the South Asia to the Tibetan Plateau is evident.

South Asia is dominated by the periodical [monsoon system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon_of_South_Asia). During the monsoon season, aloft winds are blowing towards east, hereby enabling the air pollution transport into Tibet. On the contrary, during non-monsoon season, the westerly winds are suppressed.
