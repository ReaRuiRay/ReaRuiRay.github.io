Just like a diary, a personal website is also another way to identify oneself. What are the most important factors I want to share to others? How would I identify myself? 
 
A scientist
------
I earned a Ph.D. in Earth and Atsmopheric Sciences and naturally I did numerous researches on atmospheric topics, especially, air pollution related ones. I am interested in both scientific discovery and application.

A wheel innovator
------
> To reinvent the wheel is to duplicate a basic method that has already previously been created or optimized by others (Wiki).

Engineers and scientists always scold themselves for doing duplicate works. Indeed it is not cool to spend hundreds of hours to replicate others' works exactly. 

Contrary to this practice, some go to extremes that they will use others' work whenever and wherever. This is even worse than reinventing the wheel. 

As a **physicist**, I would stand on the giant's shoulder and build whatever I please ---s using experience and vision to decide whether and to what extent we want to bother with the wheel. For example, when I tackle with a spatial interpolation problem,  I would certainly use *numba* and *numpy* of *Python* as infrastructure (well, I won't and I can't reinvent them), try existing interpolation methods (*scipy*, *esmf*), and may decide they are not built for my specific case and reinvent them.
